This has my files for the autonomous surveillance drone that I had worked on as part of Cruiseader. Mainly contains the code for the arduino integration of servos and the telemetry files.

Also contains the configuration and interfacing files for use with the onboard controller for the following:

- Digispark Compiler
- Rx and Tx for Arduino via Antennae
- UBlox GPS module
- Servo Integration (w/ Gyroscope)
